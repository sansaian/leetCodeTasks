# Intuition
The function aims to find the maximum number of instances of the word "balloon" that can be formed from the characters in the given string `text`. To achieve this, we can count the occurrence of each character in `text` and iteratively decrease the counts as we form each instance of the word "balloon".

# Approach
1. **Initialize the Hashmap**: We create a hashmap `store` to record the occurrence count of each character in the input string `text`.

2. **Count Occurrences**: Iterate through the `text`, and for each character, increment the corresponding count in the `store`.

3. **Check and Form Words**: Initialize `result` to 0, which will store the count of instances of the word "balloon". Define a `template` string as "balloon". In an infinite loop, iterate through the characters in the `template`, and for each character, decrement its count in the `store`. If any count becomes negative, we cannot form any more instances of the word, so we return the `result`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of characters in `text`. Counting the occurrences takes O(n), and then we loop through the `template` in the worst case n/len(template) times.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(c), where c is the number of unique characters in `text`. This accounts for the storage used by our hashmap.

# Code
```go
func maxNumberOfBalloons(text string) int {
	store := make(map[byte]int, len(text))
	for i := 0; i < len(text); i++ {
		store[text[i]] = store[text[i]] + 1
	}
	result := 0
	template := "balloon"
	for {
		for i := 0; i < len(template); i++ {
			store[template[i]]--
			if store[template[i]] < 0 {
				return result
			}
		}
		result++
	}
}
