# Intuition
This problem involves identifying the players who have either never lost a game or lost only once. The main concept here is to keep track of the win and lose stats for each player using a hashmap, then iterate over the stats to find the desired players.

# Approach
The `findWinners` function starts by initializing a map called `stat`, where each key represents a player's identifier and each value is a `stats` struct holding the number of games won and lost by that player.

Next, the function iterates over the given `matches` slice. For each match, it increments the win count for the player in the first position (game[0]) and the lose count for the player in the second position (game[1]).

Once the stats have been collected, the function creates a slice `result` containing two slices: one for players who never lost a game, and one for players who lost only once. It iterates over the `stat` map, appending players to the appropriate slice based on their lose count.

Finally, the function sorts the player lists in ascending order and returns the `result`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the number of players. This is because we perform a sort operation on the player lists, which takes O(n log n) time. Note that the iteration over matches and stats is linear (O(n)).
- Space complexity: The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of players. This is the space used to store the `stat` map and the `result` slices.

# Code
```go
type stats struct {
	win  int
	lose int
}

// findWinners function to find the players who never lost a game or lost only once.
func findWinners(matches [][]int) [][]int {

	// A map to hold win/lose stats for each player
	stat := make(map[int]stats)
	
	// Iterating over each match
	for _, game := range matches {
		// Incrementing the win count for the winning player
		stat[game[0]] = stats{
			win:  stat[game[0]].win + 1,
			lose: stat[game[0]].lose,
		}

		// Incrementing the lose count for the losing player
		stat[game[1]] = stats{
			win:  stat[game[1]].win,
			lose: stat[game[1]].lose + 1,
		}
	}

	// Two slices to hold the players who never lost and who lost only once
	result := [][]int{{}, {}}
	
	// Iterating over the stats map
	for k, v := range stat {
		if v.lose == 0 { // Adding players who never lost to the first slice
			result[0] = append(result[0], k)
			continue
		}
		if v.lose == 1 { // Adding players who lost only once to the second slice
			result[1] = append(result[1], k)
		}
	}
	
	// Sorting the player lists
	sort.Ints(result[0])
	sort.Ints(result[1])
	
	return result // Returning the result
}
