# Intuition
To determine if a binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST), each node must adhere to the BST property: all values on the left subtree of a node must be less than the node's value, and all values on the right subtree must be greater. This suggests a recursive traversal approach, checking at each step if the node value falls within a valid range defined by its ancestors.

# Approach
The solution involves a helper function `valid` that checks if a tree rooted at `root` is a valid BST given the constraints on the minimum and maximum values its nodes can take. For each node:
- Check if the node is `nil`; a `nil` node does not violate the BST property.
- Ensure the node's value is strictly greater than the allowed minimum and less than the allowed maximum.
- Recursively validate the left and right subtrees, adjusting the allowed maximum for the left subtree and the minimum for the right subtree to the current node's value.

### Steps
1. Start with the root node and initial minimum and maximum values set to `math.MinInt` and `math.MaxInt` to represent the smallest and largest possible integer values.
2. For each node, check if its value is within the valid range (greater than `min` and less than `max`).
3. Recursively validate the left subtree with the current node's value as the new maximum and the right subtree with the current node's value as the new minimum.
4. The tree is a valid BST if all nodes satisfy the BST property.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. For a balanced tree, h is log(n), making the space complexity O(log(n)). In the worst case of a skewed tree, h is n, making the space complexity O(n).

# Code
```go
import "math"

// Definition for a binary tree node.
type TreeNode struct {
    Val int
    Left *TreeNode
    Right *TreeNode
}

func isValidBST(root *TreeNode) bool {
    return valid(root, math.MinInt64, math.MaxInt64)
}

func valid(root *TreeNode, min int, max int) bool {
    if root == nil {
        return true
    }
    if root.Val <= min || root.Val >= max {
        return false
    }
    return valid(root.Left, min, root.Val) && valid(root.Right, root.Val, max)
}
