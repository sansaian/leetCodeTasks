# Intuition
The problem involves finding the maximum difference between the values of any two nodes connected by a path in a binary tree. This can be efficiently solved using a recursive approach, where at each node, we keep track of the maximum and minimum values seen so far on the path from the root.

# Approach
The approach is to use a helper function `findMax` that traverses the tree and at each step updates the maximum and minimum values seen so far. For each node:
- If the node is `nil`, return the difference between the maximum and minimum values seen so far.
- Update the minimum and maximum values by comparing them with the current node's value.
- Recursively calculate the maximum difference in the left and right subtrees with the updated minimum and maximum values.
- Return the maximum of the differences obtained from the left and right subtrees.

### Steps
1. Start by calling `findMax` with the root node and its value as both the initial minimum and maximum values.
2. In `findMax`:
    - If `root` is `nil`, return the difference between `maxVal` and `minVal`.
    - Update `minVal` and `maxVal` with the current node's value.
    - Recursively find the maximum difference in the left and right subtrees.
    - Return the maximum of the differences obtained from left and right subtrees.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The function performs a single pass through all nodes.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the recursion stack. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the space complexity can be O(n).

# Code
```go
func maxAncestorDiff(root *TreeNode) int {
    return findMax(root, root.Val, root.Val)
}

func findMax(root *TreeNode, minVal, maxVal int) int {
    if root == nil {
        return maxVal - minVal
    }
    minVal = min(minVal, root.Val)
    maxVal = max(maxVal, root.Val)
    leftDiff := findMax(root.Left, minVal, maxVal)
    rightDiff := findMax(root.Right, minVal, maxVal)
    return max(leftDiff, rightDiff)
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func min(a, b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
