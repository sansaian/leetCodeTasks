# Intuition
The task is to find the diameter of a binary tree, which is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The intuition suggests that for each node, the longest path through it is the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees. Hence, a depth-first search approach can be used to calculate the height of each subtree while keeping track of the maximum path length found so far.

# Approach
The solution involves a recursive function `find` that computes the height of the tree from the bottom up while updating a global variable `maxD` which keeps track of the maximum diameter found. For each node:
- If the node is `nil`, return 0, as the height of an empty tree is 0.
- Recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees.
- The local maximum path through the current node is the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees.
- Update `maxD` if the local maximum is greater than the current `maxD`.
- Return the height of the tree at the current node, which is 1 plus the maximum height of its left or right subtree.

### Steps
1. Initialize `maxD` to 0 before starting the recursion.
2. Call the recursive function `find` starting from the root.
3. In `find`:
    - Return 0 if the node is `nil`.
    - Calculate the height of the left and right subtrees.
    - Calculate the local maximum path (left height + right height).
    - Update `maxD` with the maximum of `maxD` and the local maximum path.
    - Return the height of the tree at the current node.
4. After recursion, `maxD` contains the diameter of the binary tree.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once during the recursion.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), the space complexity can be O(n).

# Code
```go
var maxD int

func diameterOfBinaryTree(root *TreeNode) int {
    maxD = 0
    find(root)
    return maxD
}

func find(root *TreeNode) int {
    if root == nil {
        return 0
    }
    left := find(root.Left)
    right := find(root.Right)
    localMax := left + right
    maxD = max(maxD, localMax)
    return max(left, right) + 1
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
