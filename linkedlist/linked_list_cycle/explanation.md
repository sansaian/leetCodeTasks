# Intuition
The problem asks to determine if a linked list has a cycle in it. A cycle in a linked list means there is a node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `Next` pointer. This can be solved using the two-pointer approach or Floyd's cycle detection algorithm, where one pointer moves twice as fast as the other pointer. If a cycle exists, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer again; if not, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.

# Approach
We initialize two pointers `slow` and `fast` to the head of the list. Then, we start a loop where `slow` moves one step at a time and `fast` moves two steps at a time.

If at any point `fast` equals `nil` or `fast.Next` equals `nil`, it means we have reached the end of the list, and we return `false` because the list does not have a cycle.

If `slow` equals `fast`, it means we have found a cycle, and we return `true`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because in the worst case, we traverse each node in the list once.

- Space complexity: The space complexity is O(1), as we only use two pointers regardless of the size of the list.

# Code
```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func hasCycle(head *ListNode) bool {
    slow,fast:=head,head
    for ;fast!=nil && fast.Next!=nil;{
        slow=slow.Next
        fast=fast.Next.Next
        if slow==fast{
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
