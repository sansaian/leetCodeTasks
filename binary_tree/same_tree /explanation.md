# Intuition
The problem is to determine if two binary trees are identical. This naturally suggests a comparison of each corresponding node in the two trees. A recursive approach comes to mind, where we compare the current node of each tree and then proceed to do the same for their left and right children.

# Approach
The solution involves a recursive function that traverses both trees simultaneously. At each step:
- We check if both current nodes are `nil`. If so, the trees at this subtree are identical.
- If one node is `nil` and the other is not, or if the values of the two nodes differ, the trees are not identical.
- We then recursively check the left children and right children of the current nodes.
- The trees are identical if and only if both the left subtrees and the right subtrees are identical.

### Steps
1. Check if both nodes are `nil`. If true, return `true` as empty trees are identical.
2. If one of the nodes is `nil` or the values of the nodes differ, return `false`.
3. Recursively check if the left children of both nodes are the same tree.
4. Recursively check if the right children of both nodes are the same tree.
5. Return `true` if both left and right subtree checks return `true`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the smaller of the two trees. In the worst case, we might have to visit all nodes if the trees are identical.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the deeper tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the space complexity can be O(n).

# Code
```go
func isSameTree(p *TreeNode, q *TreeNode) bool {
    if p == nil && q == nil {
        return true
    }
    if p == nil || q == nil {
        return false
    }
    if p.Val != q.Val {
        return false
    }
    left := isSameTree(p.Left, q.Left)
    right := isSameTree(p.Right, q.Right)
    return left && right
}
