# Intuition
When first approaching the problem of finding the number of days until a warmer temperature for each day in a list, a brute force solution might involve nested loops, checking subsequent days for each day. However, this approach could be inefficient. A more efficient strategy might involve using a stack to keep track of temperatures and their indices, allowing us to process each temperature in the list only once.

# Approach
The function `dailyTemperatures` employs a stack-based approach. The main idea is to traverse the list of temperatures and use a stack to store indices of days for which we haven't yet found a warmer temperature. For each temperature, we check if it's warmer than the temperature at the index on the top of the stack. If it is, we calculate the difference in days and update our answer array. We then push the current day's index onto the stack.

### Steps
1. Initialize an empty stack to store indices of days.
2. Create an array `ans` with the same length as `temperatures`, initialized with 0s. This array will store the number of days until a warmer temperature for each day.
3. Iterate over the `temperatures` array.
    - While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the top index of the stack:
        - Pop the top index from the stack.
        - Calculate the difference between the current index and the popped index.
        - Update the `ans` array at the popped index with this difference.
    - Push the current index onto the stack.
4. Return the `ans` array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the `temperatures` array. Each element is processed once when it is pushed onto the stack and once when it is popped, leading to linear time complexity.
- Space complexity: The space complexity is O(n), primarily due to the additional `ans` array. The stack also requires space, but it will hold fewer elements than the input array in the worst case.

# Code
```go
func dailyTemperatures(temperatures []int) []int {
	var stack []int
	ans := make([]int, len(temperatures), len(temperatures))
	for i := 0; i < len(temperatures); i++ {
		for len(stack) > 0 && temperatures[stack[len(stack)-1]] < temperatures[i] {
			j := stack[len(stack)-1]
			stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
			ans[j] = i - j
		}
		stack = append(stack, i)
	}
	return ans
}
