# Intuition
The problem asks for the minimum positive integer to be added to the first element of the array, such that even after performing all the operations, the prefix sum of any subarray in the modified array is always positive. The problem can be solved by performing a single scan of the array.

# Approach
We initialize two variables: `sum` and `minVal` to `0`. The `sum` variable keeps track of the running sum of the elements in the array while `minVal` keeps track of the minimum value of the `sum` encountered so far.

We then iterate over the array and for each element, we add its value to `sum` and update `minVal` to be the minimum of `minVal` and `sum`.

Finally, the minimum start value is `-minVal + 1`. If `minVal` is less than `0`, it means the running sum becomes negative at some point, and `-minVal + 1` will be the minimum positive integer such that the prefix sum of any subarray is always positive. If `minVal` is greater than or equal to `0`, it means the running sum is always positive and the minimum start value is `1`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we perform a single pass over the `nums` array.

- Space complexity: The space complexity is O(1), as we use a constant amount of space to store the `sum` and `minVal` variables.

# Code
```go
func minStartValue(nums []int) int {
    sum,minVal:=0,0
    for _,v:=range nums{
        sum+=v
        minVal=min(minVal,sum)
    }
    return -minVal+1
}

func min(x,y int) int{
    if x>y{
        return y
    }
    return x
}
```
