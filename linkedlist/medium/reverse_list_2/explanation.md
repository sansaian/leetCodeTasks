# Intuition
The problem asks to reverse a linked list from position `left` to position `right`. This can be solved by locating the `left-1` position node first and then reversing the sublist from `left` to `right`.

# Approach
1. **Create a Dummy Node**: Initialize a dummy node that points to the head to handle edge cases such as reversing at the very beginning of the list.
2. **Locate the `left-1` Position**: Move a pointer `prev` to its place, which is at position `left-1`.
3. **Reverse the Sublist**: Use another pointer to reverse the sublist from position `left` to `right`. While reversing, also keep track of the next node `currRev` after the reversed sublist for later reconnection.
4. **Reconnect**: Connect the `prev.Next` with the reversed sublist and also connect the end of the reversed sublist with the remaining list `currRev`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the list, because we potentially need to traverse all the nodes in the list.
- Space complexity: The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers.

# Code
```go
func reverseBetween(head *ListNode, left int, right int) *ListNode {
    // Return nil if the list is empty
    if head == nil {
        return nil
    }

    // Initialize a dummy node that points to the head
    dummy := &ListNode{Next: head}
    prev := dummy

    // Move 'prev' to its place which is at position 'left - 1'
    for i := 0; i < left-1; i++ {
        prev = prev.Next
    }
    
    // Reverse the sublist from position 'left' to 'right'
    prevRev, currRev := reverse(prev.Next, right-left+1)

    // Connect the 'prev.Next' with the reversed sublist and 
    // also connect the end of reversed sublist with the remaining list 'currRev'
    prev.Next.Next = currRev
    prev.Next = prevRev

    // Return the next node of dummy node
    return dummy.Next
}

func reverse(head *ListNode, len int) (*ListNode, *ListNode) {
    var prev *ListNode
    // Reverse 'len' nodes of the list and keep track of the next node after the reversed sublist
    for i := 0; i < len; i++ {
        nextRev := head.Next
        head.Next = prev
        prev = head
        head = nextRev
    }
    // Return the head of reversed sublist and the next node after the reversed sublist
    return prev, head
}
